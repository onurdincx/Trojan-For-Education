## Project Overview
The script implements various functionalities commonly associated with Trojan viruses, including:

- Establishing connections with a command and control (C&C) server.
- Executing commands received from the C&C server on the target system.
- Ensuring persistence by automatically running upon system startup.
- Mimicking HTTPS traffic to potentially evade detection.


## Key Features
- Utilizes Python's socket, subprocess, threading, time, and os modules for networking, command execution, thread management, and operating system-specific operations.
- Implements autorun functionality to ensure persistence by copying the malware into the user's startup programs directory.
- Incorporates a conn function to establish connections with the C&C server and a cmd function to execute commands received from the server.
- Utilizes port 443 for communication with the C&C server to mimic HTTPS traffic.
- Includes a cli function to continuously listen for commands from the C&C server and execute them asynchronously using threads.
